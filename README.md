# TypeIt 

TypeIt is a custom block type for Concrete CMS that brings your content to life with smooth, realistic typing animations. By integrating the popular TypeIt JavaScript library, this add-on allows you to easily animate text as if it’s being typed out in real time—perfect for headlines, intros, and other attention-grabbing content areas.

With intuitive backend options, you can control typing speed, delays, looping, deletions, and even multi-line sequences without writing a single line of JavaScript. Whether you’re aiming for a modern, tech-savvy feel or simply want to add some dynamic flair to your site, TypeIt makes it easy to create elegant, responsive text animations directly within Concrete CMS.
